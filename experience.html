It all started with one email that says "100% discount". Then goes the enrollment. It was very smooth and fast as their one-stop enrolment was very productive and fast Therefore giving me more time to be able to admire the campus and appreciate its views and facilities.

My first day at MCU was odd â€“ our program had only 10 students. Things got even more interesting when we found out we were supposed to merge with the IT course, then some teachers didn't show up. Despite the mix-up, we pushed through with the orientation with the remaining teachers.

Along with the arising confusion of the schedule and section split-up, our bond also continued to grow as weeks pass by. The sections may have split, but it only made us more closer together and slowly warmed up to each other.

The very first event that made us to bond and get to know each other is the general assembly. This helped me see and talk to the people behind my back during classes. Experiencing a shared laugh all together in one place.

After the general assembly, we get to meet other people through a major event held for college students. This was very fun for me as i was able to witness the yells of other courses and their energy levels. Seeing the colorful crowd with their own shirt assignment was pleasing to the eye as it also symbolizes togetherness and uniformity.

As time goes by, I am more attached to the people here in MCU specially my classmates and friends from other courses. I get to see their values through their words, actions and experiences together.
