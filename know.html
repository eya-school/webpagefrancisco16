<font color=340000 size=5 face=Comic Sans> Hi! Let me Introduce myself.<br><br>
My name is Iayanah Francisco, an 18 years old first-year student taking BS in Computer Science at Manila Central University.
<br><br><br>

 Fun facts about me.....<br><br><br>

 I am the first child in my lovely family. I'm a creative introvert with a passion for anything that revolves around art such as painting, poetry, and music. When I have my freetime, I'm probably sketching,painting and exploring new things. I love expressing myself through words and visuals.

<br><br><br>I'm a bit reserved at first, but once you get to know me, you'll see my fun and joker side. I'm all about sharing laughs and positivity, hanging out with friends and family.
